# ResumeDocAI - AI-Powered ATS Resume Checker üöÄ

 **Live Demo:** [**resumedocai.vercel.app**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://your-live-site-url.com) \#\# üìú Project Overview

ResumeDocAI is an intelligent MERN-stack web application designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Users can securely sign up, upload their resume, and receive instant, AI-powered feedback, including an overall score, a list of problems, and actionable solutions.

This project solves a common problem where qualified candidates are often rejected due to formatting or keyword issues before a human ever sees their resume.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Secure User Authentication:** Complete registration and login flow with email OTP verification using Nodemailer and password hashing with Bcryptjs.
  * **JWT-Based Authorization:** Protected routes ensure that only logged-in users can access the core analysis feature, using JSON Web Tokens for session management.
  * **AI-Powered Resume Analysis:** Integrates with the **Google Gemini API** to provide in-depth analysis of resume content against common ATS criteria.
  * **PDF Upload & Preview:** Users can drag-and-drop or select a resume file (PDF, DOCX, etc.). The application can render a preview of the uploaded PDF using `pdfjs-dist`.
  * **Conditional UI:** The user interface dynamically changes based on the user's authentication state, managed globally with React's Context API.
  * **Fully Responsive Design:** A clean and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on all devices.
